# Guess_Number_With_SMA
Guess the Number with System Multi Agents

➡ The rule of the game :

At first, the gamer guesses a number if the number is greater than the correct number, the server
requires to guess another number, and the same thing when the number is less.
When a gamer guesses the right number, the server sends the others a message telling them
the winner's name and stopping the game

✅ How achieve this?
